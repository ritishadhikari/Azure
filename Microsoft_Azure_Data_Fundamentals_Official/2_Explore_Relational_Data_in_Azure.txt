Explore fundamental relational data concepts:
    - Typically, a relational database management system (RDBMS) can enforce 
    referential integrity to ensure that a value entered into a foreign key
    field has an existing corresponding primary key in the related table

    - Some popular dialects of SQL include:
        - Transact-SQL (TSQL):
            - This version of SQL is used by Microsoft SQL server and Azure SQL
            services
        - pgSQL:
            - Implemented in PostgreSQL
        - PL/SQL:
            - Implemented in Oracle.
            - Stands for Procedural Language/SQL
    
    - Data Definition Language:
        - CREATE
        - ALTER
        - DROP
        - RENAME
    
    - Data Control Language:
        - GRANT

Explore Relational Database Service in Azure:
    - SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs):
        - A VM running in Azure with an installation of SQL Server
        - Infrastructure As a Service
        - Great option for Lift and Shift migration of existing 
        on-premise SQL server installations to the cloud
        - You can quickly resize an Azure VM without the requirement that you
        reinstall the software that is running on it
    - Azure SQL Managed Instance:
        - Platform as a Service
        - Provides near 100% compatibility with on-premises SQL Server
        instances while abstracting the underlying hardware and operations
        - Install Multiple Databases on the same instance
        - All communications are encrypted and signed using certificates
        - Managed Instances depend on other Azure Services:
            - Azure Storage for Backups
            - Azure EventHub for telemetry
            - Azure Active Directory for Authentication
            - Azure Key vault for Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
        - Use Managed Instance (and not Azure SQL Database), if your system uses features 
        such as:
            - Service Brokers
            - Database Mail
        - Use Data Migration Assistant to detect compatibility issues with your Databases
        that can impact database functionality
    - Azure SQL Database:
        - Fully Managed, highly scalable PaaS database service that is designed for
        the cloud
        - This service includes the core database-level capabilities of on-premises
        SQL Server
        - Good option when you need to create a new application in the cloud
        - Supports Single Database as well as Elastic Pool
        - Under single database, you create and run a database server in the cloud
        and you access the database through this server. You can also specify a 
        serverless configuration
        - Under Elastic Pool, Multiple Databases can share the same resources through 
        Multiple tenancy and this resource is referred to as pool
        - You create the pool and only your databases can use the pool
        - This pool model is useful, if you have databases with resource requirements
        that vary over time 
        - Elastic pool enables you to use the resources available in the pool, 
        and then release the resources once processing has completed
        - This is highly available (99.995%) and scalable
    - Azure SQL Edge:
        - SQL engine that is optimized for IoT scenarios that need to work with
        streaming time series data
    
    - One notable feature of MariaDB is its built-in support for temporal data, where
    a table can hold several versions of data, enabling an application to query the data
    as it appeared at some point in the past

    - One key fearture of PostGreSQL is the ability to store and manipulate geometric
    data, such as lines, circles and polygons

    - Azure Database for MYSQL:
        - It is a PaaS implementation of MySQL in the Azure Cloud, based on the MySQL
        community edition
        - High Availability and scalability as required with pay for what you use
        - Azure Database provides a global database system that scales up to 
        large databases with the need to manage hardware, network components, 
        virtual servers, software patches and other underlying components
        - Provides automatic backups and point-in-time restore for the last 35 days
        - Provides monitoring functionality to add alerts and to view metrics and logs
    
    - Azure Database for MariaDB:
        - Based on the MariaDB community edition
        - Fully managed and is controlled by Azure
        - Provides automatic backups and point-in-time restore for the last 35 days
    
    - Azure Database for PostGreSQL:
        - PaaS as a Service
        - Provides the same availability, performance, scaling, security and 
        administrative benefits as the MySQL service
        - Some features of on-premise PostGreSQL databases aren't available in 
        Azure Database for PostGreSQL, like extensions that users can add to a database
        to perform specialized tasks, such as writing Stored Procs in programming
        languages other than pgsql and interacting directly with the OS
        - Continue to use the pgAdmin tool to connect to Azure Database for PostgreSQL
        - Information about query run against databases on the server are saved 
        in azure_sys database and you can query the query_store.qs_view to see and 
        monitor queries that users are running
