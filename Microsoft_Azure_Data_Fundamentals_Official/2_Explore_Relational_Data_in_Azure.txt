Explore fundamental relational data concepts:
    - Typically, a relational database management system (RDBMS) can enforce 
    referential integrity to ensure that a value entered into a foreign key
    field has an existing corresponding primary key in the related table

    - Some popular dialects of SQL include:
        - Transact-SQL (TSQL):
            - This version of SQL is used by Microsoft SQL server and Azure SQL
            services
        - pgSQL:
            - Implemented in PostgreSQL
        - PL/SQL:
            - Implemented in Oracle.
            - Stands for Procedural Language/SQL
    
    - Data Definition Language:
        - CREATE
        - ALTER
        - DROP
        - RENAME
    
    - Data Control Language:
        - GRANT
