Virtual Machines:
    - Infrastructure as a Service:
        - Manage everything except the hardware
        - This includes the networking components
    - Tools:
        - Use the Azure Portal to manage large number of VMs and even hybrid clouds
    - Compliance:
        - Use Azure Blueprints to make your VMs comply with company guidelines
    - Recommendations:
        - Azure will recommend improvements to ensure better security, higher availability and 
        greater performance
    - Choice:
        - Chose amount of RAM, number of CPUs, Windows or Linux
    - Pricing:
        - Goes up as RAM and CPU goes up. Calculated Hourly. 
    -    

Scale Sets:
    - Helps to create a group of identical, load balanced VMs
    - Multiple VMS:
        - Simple to manage multiple identical VMs using a load balancer
    - High availability:
        - If one VM fails or stops, the others in the scale set will keep working
    - Auto Scaling:
        - Automatically match demand by adding or removing VMs from the scale set
    - Large Scale:
        - Run up to 1000 VMs in a single set
    - No Extra Cost:
        - No added cost using scale sets

App Services:
    - Part of Platform as a Service
    - Servers, Network and Storage are all managed by Azure
    - Focus just on business value and logic
    - Categories:
        - Web Apps:
