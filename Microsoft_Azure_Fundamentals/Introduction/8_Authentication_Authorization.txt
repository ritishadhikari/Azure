Azure Active Directory
    - Main Tool to manage users and permissions on Azure
    - Active Directory was designed for traditional office use with computers and printers
    - The web as a concept or service was not part of the design for Active Directory in 2000
    - Active Directory authentication uses services that aren't available on Azure
    - Active Directory is not Azure Active Directory
    - You cannot have an Azure account without an AAD service
    - Every Azure account needs a first user and this user is in the initial AAD instance
    - A tenant represents the organization, which is a dedicated instance of AAD that an organization
    receives when signing up for Azure
    - Each tenant is distict and completely separate from other AAD tenants
    - Each user in Azure can be a member or guest of up to 500 Azure AD tenants
    - Subscriptions are billing entities and all resources within a subscription are billed togather
    - All resources within a subscription are billed togather and you can have a multiple Subscriptions
    within a tenant to separate costs
    - If a subscription isn't paid, all the resources and services associated with the subscription
    stop
    - AAD bridges the On-Premise and Azure
