Storage Accout is a Globally Unique Azure Namespace and every object in Azure has its own web address

Blob:
    - Binary Large Object
    - Storage Accounts are Buckets while Containers are Objects
    - Blobs of Data are stored in containers inside the storage account
    - Blob Types:
        - Block:
            - Store text and binary data upto 4.7 TB. Made up of individually managed blocks of data
        - Append:
            - Block blobs that are optimized for append operations. Works well for logging where data
            is constantly appended
        - Page:
            - Store files upto 8 TB. Any part of the file could be accessed at any time, for example 
            a virtual hard drive
    - Pricing Tiers:
        - Hot:
            - Frequently Accessed files. Lower access times and higher consists
        - Cool:
            - Lower storage costs and higher access times. Data remains here for at least 30 days
        - Archive:
            - Lowest costs and highest access times

Disk:
    - Azure manages the disks, you don't have to worry about backup and uptime
    - Microsoft and Azure guarantees size and performance as per your agreement with them
    - Easy to upgrade your disk size and type
    - Disk Types:
        - HDD:
            - Spinning hard drive.
            - Low cost and suitable backups
        - Standard SSD:
            - Standard for production. Higher reliability, scalability and lower latency over HDD
        - Premium SSD:
            - Super fast and high performance. 
            - Very low latency. 
            - Use for critical workloads
        - Ultra Disk:
            - For the most demanding, data intensive workloads. 
            - Disks upto 64TB. 
            - Disks upto 64 TB.

File:
    - Share access to the Azure file storage across machines and provide access to your on-premise
    infrastructure
    - Managed; You don't have to worry about hardware or operating system
    - Resilient as network and power outages won't affect your storage
    - Scenarios:
        - Supplement or replace your existing on-premise file storage solution
        - Move your existing file storages and related services to Azure - Lift and Shift

Archive:
    - Azure Archive Storage
    - Policies, legislation and recovery can be requirements for archiving data. These can be very 
    large amounts of data
    - Archive storage is blob storage, so the same tools will work for both
    - The archive tier is the lowest price for storage on Azure. A few dollars a month can get you
    terabytes of space
    - Features includes durability, encryted and stable. It is perfectly suited for data that is accessed 
    infrequently
    - With cheap archive storage, you can free up your more premium on-premises Storage
    - Fully secure to allow for any personal data such as financial records, medical data and more 

Storage Redundancies:
    - Data redundancies protects against unplanned failures
    - Azure storage always creates multiple copies of your data which happens automatically with
    minimum three copies of your data and is invisible to the end user
    - Higher redundancies comes with higher costs
    - Multiple Redundancies Options:
        - Different location scope
            - Single Zone   
                - Locally redundant storage (LRS)
                    - Creates three copies of data in a single location
                    - Lowest cost options
                    - Protects against single disk failure
                    - Does not protect against zone or regional outages   
            - Multiple Zone
                - Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS)
                    - Creates three copies of data in a three availability zones
                    - Protects against zone outage but not regional outage
            - Multiple Regions
                - Geo Redundant Storage (GRS)
                    - Three copies in two different regions
                        - Three copies in primary regional physical location (LRS)
                        - Three copies in secondary (paired) region physical location (LRS) 
                    - Protects against primary region failure but no primary region zone redundancy
                    - Can configure read access from secondary region for high availability 
                - Geo Zone Redundant Storage (GZRS)
                    - Copy across three availability zones in primary region (ZRS)
                    - Three copies in secondary region physical location/ zone (LRS)
                    - Protect against primary region failure and primary region zone failure
                    - Can configure read access from secondary region for high availability
