Snapshot:
    - Automate taking copy of the databases every hour to another data center in London
    - You can setup latest snapshot, but depending on when failure occurs you can lose upto an 
    hour of data
    - Database will slow while taking snapshot

Transaction Logs:
    - You can setup database from latest snapshot and apply transaction logs

Standby:
    - Standby Database in the second data center with replication synchronously
    - Snapshot is taken from the standby database
    - Hence Main Database will not be slow

Increase Availability:
    - Multiple Standbys
    - Distribute Database across multiple Zones and Regions

Increasing Durability:
    - Multiple Copies of data (standbys, snapshots, transaction logs and replicas)
    - Replicating data comes with its own challenges    

RTO & RPO:
    - Recovery Point Objective:
        - Maximum acceptable period of data loss
    - Recovery Time Objective:
        - Maximum acceptable downtime 

Consistency:
    - Ensure that data in multiple database instances (standbys and replicas) is updated simultaneously
    - Strong Consistency through Synchronous Replication to all replicas, it will be slow if there are
    multiple replicas or standbys
    - Eventual Consistency through Asynchronous Replication. A little lag few seconds - before the change
    is available in all replicas. In the intermediate periods, different replicas might return different 
    values. Used when scalability is more important than data integrity
    - Read After write consistency where inserts are immediately available while updates would have 
    eventual consistency

OLTP:
    - Large number of users make large number of small transactions
    - Small data reads, updates and deletes
    - ERP, CRMs, ECommerce, Banking
    - Ex: 
        - Azure SQL Database: 
            - Managed Microsoft SQL Server
            - Flexible and responsive serverless compute    
            - Hyperscale upto 100 TB of storage
        - Azure Database for MySQL: 
            - Managed MySQL
        - Azure Database for PostgreSQL: 
            - Managed PostgreSQL
            - Supports Single Server or Hyperscale options  
    - All Azure Relational db service provides 99.99% Availability
    - Uses Row Storage

OLAP:
    - Allows users to analyze petabytes of data
    - Data is consolidated from multiple (transactional) databases
    - Azure Synapse Analytics (Azure SQL Data Warehouse):
        - Petabyte scale distributed data warehouse
        - Provide a unified experience for developing end to end analytics solutions - Data
        Integration + Enterprise Data Warehousing + Big Data Analytics 
        - Enables massive parallel processing
        - Run complex queries across petabytes of data
        - Use columnar storage with high compression which helps to distribute data in multiple cluster
        nodes

NoSQL Database:
    - Provides Flexible Schema
    - Allows to horizontally scale to petabytes of data with millions Transactions Per Second 
    - Azure Cosmos DB:
        - Fully Managed NoSQL database service
        - Global Database which automatically replicates data across multiple Azure Regions 
        - Single digit millisecond response times
        - 99.999 percent availability 
        - Provides Automatic Scaling (Serverless)
        - Supports APIs for MongoDB (document), Cassandra (key/value) and Gremlin (graph)

InMemory Databases:
    - Not Persistent in Disk
    - Persistent in Memory with micro second latency and high throughput
    - Azure Cache for Redis:
        - Cache
        - Session Management
        - Gaming Leaderboard
        - Geospatial application
