Snapshot:
    - Automate taking copy of the databases every hour to another data center in London
    - You can setup latest snapshot, but depending on when failure occurs you can lose upto an 
    hour of data
    - Database will slow while taking snapshot

Transaction Logs:
    - You can setup database from latest snapshot and apply transaction logs

Standby:
    - Standby Database in the second data center with replication synchronously
    - Snapshot is taken from the standby database
    - Hence Main Database will not be slow

Increase Availability:
    - Multiple Standbys
    - Distribute Database across multiple Zones and Regions

Increasing Durability:
    - Multiple Copies of data (standbys, snapshots, transaction logs and replicas)
    - Replicating data comes with its own challenges
