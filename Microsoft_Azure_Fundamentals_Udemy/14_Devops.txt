Continous Integration:
    - Continously run tests and packaging
Continous Deployment:
    - Continiously deploy to test environments
Continous Delivery:
    - Continously deploy to production

CI,CD Tools:
    - Azure Repos - Private Source Control (Git). Alternative is Github.
    - Azure Pipelines - Orchestrate CI/CD Pipelines. Alternative is Github Actions.
    - Azure Boards - Scrum, Agile and Kanban Boards
    - Azure Artifacts - Artifact repositories to store Artifacts
    - Azure Test Plans - Automation Test Tools to check software quality. Integrate into CI/CD 
    pipelines

Infrastructure as a Code:
    - Treat Infrastructure the same way as application Code
    - Track your infrastructure changes over time (version control)
    - Bring Repeatibility into your infrastructure
    - Infrastructure Provisioning through Terraform
        - Provision compute, database, storage and networking
        - Terraform is Open source cloud neutral 
    - Azure Service is called Azure Resource Manager Templates (ARM)
    - Can also use Powershell or Azure CLI Automation instead of ARM, but they are not powerful
    - Configuration Management
        - Install right software and tools on the provisioned resources
        - Open Source Tools - Chef, Puppet, Ansible 

ARM:
    - Deployment and Management Service in Azure
    - All actions to any resource in Azure go through ARM
    - Avoid Configuration drift by standardizing it with a JSON file - ARM Template
    - Avoid mistakes with manual configuration 
    - Declarative approach to Infrastructure as Code
    - Parallize creation of resources when possible
    - Version Control and Automatic rollback in case of failures
    - Powershell and Bash Scripts can also be used to write IAAC through Imperative way

Azure Cloud Shell supports both CLI (Bash) and Powershell 

DevTest Labs:
    - Quickly provision development and Test Environments through windows and Linux environments
    - Uses ARM templates
    - Can be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines
    - Set Automated Shutdowns to minimize costs
