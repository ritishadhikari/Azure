Multiple Resources tagged to Resource Groups

Multiple Resource Groups are tagged to specific subscription

Multiple Subscription are tagged to a Specific Management Groups

No heirarchy in resource groups but management groups can have a heirarchy where-in inside a 
managament group we can have another management group

A specific resource can be associated with only one Resource Group

Tags applied to a resource group are not automatically applied to resources 

Permissions/Roles assigned to user at the resource group level are inherited by all resources
in the group 

You need a subscription to create resources in Azure as the Resources will be tagged to the 
Resource Group and the Resource Group will be tagged to the Subscription 

An Azure Subscription can have multiple subscriptions and multiple account administrators

Create Subscriptions based on:
    - Managing different access-management policies for different environments
    - Manage costs across different departments of an organization 
    - If limits are exceeding for the present subscription
        - Max of 25000 VMs per region per subscription

Two different subscriptions cannot be merged into one, however resources can be moved from one 
subscription to another

You can transfer ownership of a subscription (needs owner role)

If subscription expires, you will not be able to create new resources in the subscription, but you can 
continue to access the data stored

Each subscription is associated with quotas and you can create support request for increasing the quota 
for a specific subscription

You cannot change the spending limit for a subscription, but you can remove it

Azure Subscriptions can have more than one account admin

Resource Group is just a container, you will not be billed for Resource Group (but you will be billed
for resources created in Resource Group)

All subscriptions and resources under a management group inherit all constraints applied to it

All subscriptions in a management group should be associated with the same Azure AD Tenant
