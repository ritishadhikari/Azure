Virtual Network:
    - Each Virtual Network is created in a region
    - Control all the traffic coming in and going outside a Virtual Network
    - Best Practice is to create all your Azure resources (compute, storage, database, etc) within
    a Virtual Network
    - Each VM in a VNET is assigned a private IP address, but we can assign a public IP address and 
    make it static

Subnets:
    - Each type of resources has its own access needs
    - Helps to separate public resources from private resources inside a Virtual Network
    - Create different subnets for public and private resources
    - All the resources in a Virtual Network spread across subnets can talk to each other
    - Resources in the same VNet can communicate using private IP addresses

Network Peering:
    - Connect resources in different Virtual Network
    - Peered Networks can be in different regions

Network Security:
    - DDoS Attacks:
        - Basic: Enabled by Default. no extra cost
        - DDOS Protection Standard: 
            - Mitigates 60 different DDOS attack
            - Get a cost guarantee (Receive Service credit if DDOS attack results in scale-out)
    - Azure Firewall:
        - Managed Network Security Service to control in and out of an Azure Network
        - Stateful: Once traffic in is allowed, traffic out is automatically allowed
        - Control traffic to multiple networks across multiple subscriptions through a single 
        firewall
        - Integrates with Azure Monitor for logs and analytics
    - Web Application Firewall:
        - Restricts traffic to a web application
        - Prevents against Web Application Security attacks (OWASP), EX. SQL injection

    - Network Security Group:
        - It is like an internal firewall inside your Virtual Network right before your resources
        - It has multiple inbound and outbound security rules
        - Allows/Restricts traffic between resources such as Virtual Machines and Subnets
        - Typically attached with subnets and network interfaces
        - Allow access to webservers only on port 80 and 443 or allow database access only to web
        servers and not to the outside world

Private Link:
    - Setup Private Link (PAAS) and connect using private endpoint(VM) between a VM inside a subnet 
    inside a Vnet hosting a web app and an Azure SQL managed DB.
    - Azure Private Link enables access to Azure PaaS services (Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB,
    Azure SQL Database, etc) from resources in your VNet using private endpoints
    - All data that flows from a VM to SQL Database is isolated from the internet and stays on the 
    Microsoft back end 

Defense in Depth:
    - Physical Security: Physical Infrastructure
    - Perimeter: Azure DDOS Protection + Azure Firewall
    - Network: Through Network Security Groups
    - Compute: Through SSH Private and Public key and Patching
    - Application: Azure Key Vault
    - Data (Rest and Transit): Encryption & Private Link

Zero Trust:
    - Zero trust Policy: Identity, Location, Device, Resource, Data Classification, Time
    - Use least privilege access
    - Assume Breach  
    - End to end Encryption, 
    - Continous Monitoring
    - Authentication and Authorization
    - Continous Updates and Automated Threat Detection

Private Cloud ensures higher level of security and privacy than Public Cloud 

Expressroute provides 
    - private connectivity (Traffic does not go over the internet)
    - very high bandwidth
    - High Security
    - Traffic is not encrypted (unlike in VPN)
