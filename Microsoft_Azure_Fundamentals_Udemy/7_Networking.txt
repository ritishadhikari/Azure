Virtual Network:
    - Each Virtual Network is created in a region
    - Control all the traffic coming in and going outside a Virtual Network
    - Best Practice is to create all your Azure resources (compute, storage, database, etc) within
    a Virtual Network
    - Each VM in a VNET is assigned a private IP address, but we can assign a public IP address and 
    make it static

Subnets:
    - Each type of resources has its own access needs
    - Helps to separate public resources from private resources inside a Virtual Network
    - Create different subnets for public and private resources
    - All the resources in a Virtual Network spread across subnets can talk to each other
    - VNET in the same VNet can communicate using private IP addresses

Network Peering:
    - Connect resources in different Virtual Network
    - Peered Networks can be in different regions

Network Security:
    - DDoS Attacks:
        - Basic: Enabled by Default. no extra cost
        - DDOS Protection Standard: 
            - Mitigates 60 different DDOS attack
            - Get a cost guarantee (Receive Service credit if DDOS attack results in scale-out)
    - Azure Firewall:
        - Managed Network Security Service to control in and out of an Azure Network
        - Stateful: Once traffic in is allowed, traffic out is automatically allowed
        - Control traffic to multiple networks across multiple subscriptions through a single 
        firewall
        - Integrates with Azure Monitor for logs and analytics
    - Web Application Firewall:
        - Restricts traffic to a web application
        - Prevents against Web Application Security attacks (OWASP), EX. SQL injection
        -
