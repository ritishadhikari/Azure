Identity Management (AD):
    - Identities (human and non human) need to access resources and perform actions (ex. stop, start, or 
    terminate a virtual machine)
    - Azure Active Directory helps in identifying users in the cloud, configure resources they can
    access and configure what actions to allow

    Centralized way and use it across multiple apps and services
    - Active Directory helps to define Users, Credentials and their access rights. It also supports 
    creation of groups

    - Azure AD self-service password reset can be enabled by Global Admins to allow users to reset
    passwords by themselves
    - Subscriptions are connected to an active Azure AD Directory
    - You can transfer a subscription to a different Azure Active Directory
