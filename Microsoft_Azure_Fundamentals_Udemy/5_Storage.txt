Azure Queue: Decouple applications using messaging

Region pair ensures high availability and high durability. Access data from Primary region with 
an option to failover to secondary region if primary region is not available. Region Pairs have very
fast connection

Premium and Ultra Disks provide very high Availability and high fault tolerance

By default managed disk is chosen while creating a VM, we can chose to use an Unmanaged disk 
by unclicking the managed disk selection from the advanced subtab of disk tab. Unmanaged disk are
stored in Containers inside the storage account unlike in the disk in case of managed disk.

Containers, File Shares, Queues and Storage Accounts needs Storage Accounts

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: 
    - Azure Blob Storage Enhanced
    - Designed for enterprise big data analytics
    - It allows to store Exabytes of data
    - Provides Heirarchy unlike flat structure in normal Blob Storage
    - Low cost, tiered storage with high availability and recovery

To access an archive blob storage we need to "rehydrate", which means either change it to access
