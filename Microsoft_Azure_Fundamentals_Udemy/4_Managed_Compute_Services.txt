Azure App Service: 
    - Azure App Service is a fully managed platform (PAAS) for building, deploying and scaling web
    apps. It also natively supports REST APIs, and mobile back ends.
    - Azure App Service natively supports many programming language with automated deployment, 
    management, load balancing and auto scaling. 
    - The only thing to consider in App Service is the App Service Plan which defines a set of compute
    resources for the web app app
    - We have scale out and scale up features

MicroServices:
    - Create Docker Images for each microservice
    - Docker Image has all needs of a micro service (JDK, Python, NodeJS) 
    - Docker provides Isolation for containers and it is cloud neutral

Azure Container Instances:
    - Manage and run simple container based instances
    - No need to provision or manage VMs

Container Orchestration:
    - Features:
        - Auto Scaling
        - Load Balancing
        - Self Healing
        - Service Discovery:
            - Help Micro-Services find one another
        - Zero Downtime Deployments
    - Azure Services:
        - Azure Kubernetes Service is the managed Kubernetes Service
        - Azure Service Fabric is Microsoft's container orchestrator

Serverless:
    - No need to worry about servers, just focus on your code
    - Azure Functions Operate on the following triggers:
        - HTTP Trigger
        - Timer Trigger
        - Azure Queue Storage Trigger
        - Azure Service Bus Trigger
        - Azure Blob Storage Trigger

Software as a Service:
    - Centrally hosted software, mostly on the cloud
    - Offerred on a subscription basis, mostly pay-as-you go
    - CRM, ERP and Document Management xAgxlSugTv670vff0MnSz1xVAFxVdco716oxKzScYDzQpnfDmkrOB4oRCZZcqlpW
    - Customer is responsible only for Configuring the Software, rest are 
    Cloud Provider's responsibility

Shared Responsibility Model:
    - Information, Data, Devices (Mobiles), Accounts and Identities are always
    responsibilities of the customer 
    - Network Control and Applications are shared between customer and cloud
    providers in PAAS, for SAAS it is only the cloud providers
