    - Makes it possible to index previously unsearchable documents and to extract and surface 
    insights from large amounts of data quickly

Challenges and Risks of AI:
    - Bias can affect results   
    - Errors may cause harm
    - Data may be exposed
    - Solutions may not work for everyone
    - Users must trust a complex system
    - Who's liable for AI-driven decisions

Responsible AI:
    - Fairness:
        - AI systems should treat all people fairly
    - Reliability and Safety:   
        - Unreliability in autonomous vehicles or recommending patient symptoms can result in 
        substantial risk to human life
        - AI based system must be subjected to rigorous testing and deployment management
        processes to ensure they work as expected before release
    - Privacy and Security: 
        - Data and decisions made from the data are subject to privacy and security concerns

        - Should bring benefits to all parts of society, regardless of physical ability, gender,
        sexual orientation, ethnicity or other factors
    - Transparency:
        - AI Systems should be understandable and intrepretable
        - Users should be made fully aware of the purpose of the system, how it works and what
        limitations may be expected
    - Accountability:
        - Designers and developers of AI based solutions should work with a framework of 
        governance and organizational principles that ensure the solution meets ethical standards
        and legal standards that are clearly defined
        - People should be accountable for AI systems
