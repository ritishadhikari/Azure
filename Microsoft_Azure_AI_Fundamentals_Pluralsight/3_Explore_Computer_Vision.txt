Analyze images with the Computer Vision service:
    The computer vision service is a cognitive service in Microsoft Azure that provides pre-built 
    computer vision capabilities. 

    The service can analyze images, and return detailed information about an image and the objects 
    it depicts

    To use the Computer Vision Service, you would need to create a resource for it in your Azure 
    Subscription. You can use either of the following resource types:
        - Computer Vision:
            - A specific resource for the computer vision service.
            - Use this resource type if you don't intend to use any other cognitive services, or if 
            you want to track utilization and costs for your computer vision resource separately
        - Cognitive Services:
            - A general cognitive services resource that includes Computer vision along with many other 
            cognitive services; such as Text Analytics, Translator Text, and others.
            - Use this resource type if you plan to use multiple cognitive services and want to simplify
            administration and development 

    Either of the above two service provides two pieces of information:
        - Key for authentication
        - Endpoint providing the HTTP address at which your resources can be accessed

    Offerrings from Computer Vision Service:
        - Describing an Image:
            - Generate Human readable phrase or sentence that can describe what was detected in the image
            - Depending on the image contents, the service may return multiple results, or phrases
            - Each returned images will have an associated confidence score, indicating how confident the
            algorithm is in the supplied description
            - The highest confidence phrases will be listed first
        - Tagging Visual Features:
            - The image descriptions generated by computer vision are based on a set of thousands of 
            recognizable objects, which can be used to suggest tags for the image
            - These tags can be associated with the image as metadata that summarizes attributes of the 
            image
            - Ex:
                - SkyScrapper
                - Tower
        - Detecting Objects:
            - This service can identify common objects
            - It can also return through a bounding box co-ordinates, a set of co-ordinates that
            indicate the top, left, width and height of the object detected
        - Detecting Brands:
            - This service provides the ability to identify commercial brands
            - The service has an existing database of thousands of globally recognized logos from 
            commercial brands of products
            - If a known brand is detected, the service returns a response that contains the brand name, 
            a confidence score (from 0 to 1 indicating how positive the identification is) and a 
            bounding box for where in the image of the detected brand was found
        - Detecting Faces:
            - This service can detect and analyze human faces in an image, including the ability to 
            determine age and a bounding box rectangle for the location of the faces
            - The facial analysis capabilities of the computer service are a subset of those provided 
            by the dedicated Face Service
        - Categorizing an Image:
            - Service that categorize images based on their contents
            - It uses a parent/child heirarchy with a "current" limited set of categories
            - When analyzing an image, detected objects are compared to the existing categories to 
            determine the best way to provide the categorization
        - Detecting Domain Specific Content:
            - Supports two specialized domain models:
                - Celebrities
                - Landmarks
        - Optical Character Recognition:
            - Used for OCR capabilities to detect printed and handwritten text in images
        - Additional Capabilities:
            - Detect Image Types
            - Detect Image Color Schemes
            - Generate Thumbnails: Creating small versions of images
            - Moderate Content

Classify images with the Custom Vision service:
    - Training an effective CNN is a complex task that requires considerable expertise in data 
    science and machine learning
    - Common techniques used to train image classification models have been encapsulated into 
    the Custom Vision Cognitive service in Microsoft Azure, making it easy to train a model
    and publish it as a software service with minimal knowledge of deep learning techniques
    - There are two main tasks for creating an image classification solution with Custom Vision:
        - Use existing images to train the model 
        - Publish the model so that client applications can use it to generate predictions
    - The following types of resources can be used for the Azure Subscription:
        - Custom Vision:
            - A dedicated resource for the custom vision service, which can be training, a prediction, 
            or both resources.
        - Cognitive Services:
            - A general cognitive services resource that includes Custom Vision along with many other 
            cognitive services. 
            - You can use this type of resource for training, prediction, or both.
    - The simplest approach is to use a general Cognitive Services resource for both training and 
    prediction
    - This means you only need to concern yourself with one endpoint (the HTTP address at which your 
    service is hosted) and key (a secret value used by client applications to authenticate themselves).
    - If you choose to create a Custom Vision resource, you will be prompted to choose training, 
    prediction, or both - and it's important to note that if you choose "both", then two resources are 
    created - one for training and one for prediction
    - It's also possible to take a mix-and-match approach in which you use a dedicated Custom 
    Vision resource for training, but deploy your model to a Cognitive Services resource for prediction.
    - For the above to work, the training and prediction resources must be created in the same region.
    - Perform Model Training with:
        - Custom Vision portal
        - Or if you have the necessary coding experience you can use one of the Custom Vision service 
        programming language-specific software development kits (SDKs)
    - Model Training's key consideration is that when using images for classification, is to ensure that 
    you have sufficient images of the objects in question and those images should be of the object 
    from many different angles
    - Model Evaluation happens through:
        - Precision
        - Recall
        - Average Precision (Recall)
    - Once model is evaluates, you can publish the model to the prediction resource.
    - To use model for prediction, client application developers need the following information:
        - Project ID:
            - The unique ID of the Custom Vision project you created to train the model
        - Model name
            - The name you assigned to the model during publishing
        - Prediction endpoint:
            - The HTTP address of the endpoints for the prediction resource to which you published 
            the model (not the training resource).  
        - Prediction key: 
            - The authentication key for the prediction resource to which you published the model
            (not the training resource)

Detect objects in images with the Custom Vision service:
    - Uses of Object Detection:
        - Checking for Building Safety
        - Driving Assistance with Lane Assist Capabilities
        - Detecting Tumors
    - An object detection model is used to identify the individual objects in an image and return 
    the following information:
        - Class of each object identified in the image
        - The probability score of the object classification
        - The coordinates of a bounding box for each object
