The computer vision service is a cognitive service in Microsoft Azure that provides pre-built 
computer vision capabilities. 

The service can analyze images, and return detailed information about an image and the objects 
it depicts

To use the Computer Vision Service, you would need to create a resource for it in your Azure 
Subscription. You can use either of the following resource types:
    - Computer Vision:
        - A specific resource for the computer vision service.
        - Use this resource type if you don't intend to use any other cognitive services, or if 
        you want to track utilization and costs for your computer vision resource separately
    - Cognitive Services:
        - A general cognitive services resource that includes Computer vision along with many other 
        cognitive services; such as Text Analytics, Translator Text, and others.
        - Use this resource type if you plan to use multiple cognitive services and want to simplify
        administration and development 

Either of the above two service provides two pieces of information:
    - Key for authentication
    - Endpoint providing the HTTP address at which your resources can be accessed

Offerrings from Computer Vision Service:
    - Describing an Image:
        - Generate Human readable phrase or sentence that can describe what was detected in the image
        - Depending on the image contents, the service may return multiple results, or phrases
        - Each returned images will have an associated confidence score, indicating how confident the
        algorithm is in the supplied description
        - The highest confidence phrases will be listed first
    - Tagging Visual Features:
        - The image descriptions generated by computer vision are based on a set of thousands of 
        recognizable objects, which can be used to suggest tags for the image
        - These tags can be associated with the image as metadata that summarizes attributes of the 
        image
        - Ex:
            - SkyScrapper
            - Tower
    - Detecting Objects:
        - This service can identify common objects
        - It can also return through a bounding box co-ordinates, a set of co-ordinates that
        indicate the top, left, width and height of the object detected
    - Detecting Brands:
        - This service provides the ability to identify commercial brands
        - The service has an existing database of thousands of globally recognized logos from 
        commercial brands of products
        - If a known brand is detected, the service returns a response that contains the brand name, 
        a confidence score (from 0 to 1 indicating how positive the identification is) and a 
        bounding box for where in the image of the detected brand was found
    - Detecting Faces:
        - This service can detect and analyze human faces in an image, including the ability to 
        determine age and a bounding box rectangle for the location of the faces
        - The facial analysis capabilities of the computer service are a subset of those provided 
        by the dedicated Face Service
    - Categorizing an Image:
        - Service that categorize images based on their contents
        - It uses a parent/child heirarchy with a "current" limited set of categories
        - When analyzing an image, detected objects are compared to the existing categories to 
        determine the best way to provide the categorization
    - Detecting Domain Specific Content:
        - Supports two specialized domain models:
            - Celebrities
            - Landmarks
    - Optical Character Recognition:
        - Used for OCR capabilities to detect printed and handwritten text in images
    - Additional Capabilities:
        - Detect Image Types
        - Detect Image Color Schemes
        - Generate Thumbnails: Creating small versions of images
        - Moderate Content
