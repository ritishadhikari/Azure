Describe SQL Server Integration Service:
    - SSIS is a platform for building complex ETL solutions
    - SSIS is a component within SQL Server and consists of a Windows Service that
    manages the execution of ETL workflows, along with several tools and components
    for developing those workflows
    - It is typically used to develop integration pipelines for on-premises data
    warehousing solutions
    - It can also be used to create data migration pipelines when migrating data 
    between different systems
    - In SSIS, a project is the unit of deployment for SSIS solutions.
    - A projects contains one or more packages, each defining a workflow of tasks
    to be executed

Understand the Azure SSIS Integration Runtime:
    - To lift and shift SSIS workloads, you can create an Azure-SSIS IR to natively
    execute SSIS packages
    - Selecting the right location for your Azure-SSIS IR is essential to achieve 
    high performance in your extract-transform-load (ETL) workflows
    - In order to make use of the Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime, it is assumed that
    there is an SSIS catalogue (SSIDB) deployed on a SQL server SSIS Instance. Post
    that the Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime is capable of lifting and shifting 
    existing SSIS workloads
    - During provisioning of Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime, you specify the following
    options:
        - The node size (including the number of cores) and the number of nodes in the
        cluster
        - The existing instance of Azure SQL Database to host the SSIS Catalogue 
        Database (SSISDB), and the service tier for the database
        - The maximum parallel executions per node
    - After tne Azure-SSIS IR is enabled, you are able to manage, monitor and schedule
    SSIS packages using tools such as SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or SQL
    Server Data Tools (SSDT)
