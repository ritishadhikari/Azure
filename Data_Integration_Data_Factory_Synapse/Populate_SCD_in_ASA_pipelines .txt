Describe Slowly Changing Dimensions:
- A Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) is one that appropriately manages the 
change of dimension members ver time. It applies when the values of a business 
entity change over time and not on a set schedule.
- For SCD, the changing member should remain in the dimension table
- Scenrio: When your customer's employer name and email address changes 
over time

Choose between Slowly changing Dimension Types:
    - Type 1 SCD:
        - It always reflects the latest values and when changes in source 
        data is detected, the dimension table data is overridden
    - Type 2 SCD:
        - It supports the versioning of dimension members
        - The dimension table must use a surrogate key to provide a unique
        reference to a version of the dimension member  
        - It also includes columns that define the date range validity
        of the version (start date and end date) and possibly a flag column
        (IsCurrent) 
    - Type 3 SCD:
        - Supports storing two versions of a dimension member as separate columns
        - The table includes a column for the current value of a member plus 
        either the original or previous value of the member
        - Hence it uses additional columns to track one key instance of history,
        rather than storing additional rows to track each change like in Type 2
    - Type 6 SCD:
        - Combines Type 1, 2 and 3
        - When a change happens to a type 2 member, you creates a new row with
        appropriate start date and end date
        - In type 6 design, you also store the current value in all versions of
        that entity so you can easily report on the current value or the 
        historical value
