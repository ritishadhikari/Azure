Explore Azure Machine Learning workspace resources and assets:
    -  Azure Machine Learning provides a platform for data scientists to train, deploy 
    and manage their machine learning models on the Microsoft Azure platform
    - It provides a comprehensive set of resources and assets to train and deploy
    effective ML models
    - To use these resources and assets, you create Azure Machine Learning workspace
    resource in your Azure Subscription
    - In this workspace, you can manage data, compute resources, models, endpoints, 
    and other artifacts related to your machine learning workloads
    
    - As a part of Azure ML Workspace, the following are provided:
        - Azure Storage Account:
            - To store files and notebooks used in the workspace and to store metadata
            of jobs and models
        - Azure Key Vault:
            - To securely manage secrets such as authentication keys and credentials used by The
            workspace
        - Application Insights:
            - To monitor predictive services in the workspace
        - Azure Container Registry:
            - Created when needed to store images for Azure Machine Learning environments
    
    Create Azure ML Workspace using:
        - Azure Portal  
        - Azure Resource Manager Template (ARM)
        - Azure Command Line Interface (CLI)
        - Azure ML Python SDK
    
    Access is granted in Azure using Role Based access control (RBAC) with three built in roles that
    you can use across resources and resource groups to assign permission to users:
        - Owner:
            - Gets full access to the resource and can grant access to others using access control
        - Contributor:
            - Gets full access to all resources, but can't grant access to others
        - Reader:
            - Can only view the resource, but isn't allowed to make any changes
    
    Additional specific built-in roles:
        - AzureML Data Scientist
        - AzureML Compute Operator
    
    To fully customize permissions, we create a custom role

    Azure Machine Learning Resource:
        - The Workspace
        - Compute resources:
            - Compute Cluster
            - Inference Cluster
            - Attached Compute
            - Compute Instance
        - DataStores:  
            - All data is stored in DataStores which are references to Azure Data Services
    
    Azure Machine Learning Assets:
        - Models:
            - Train ML models with frameworks like Sklearn, Pytorch, etc
            - Common ways to store a model is wih pkl
        - Environments:
            - Specify Software packages, environment variables and software settings to run scripts
            - Environment is stored as an image in the Azure Container Registry created with the 
            workspace when it's used for the first time
        - Data:
            - As Data Assets
            - Name and Version your Data Assets
        = Components:
            - Make it easier to share code with a component in a workspace

    Authoring of ML can be done with:
        - Designer
        - Automated ML
        - Notebooks
            - Run a script as a job in Azure Machine Learning
            - When you submit a job to the workspace, all inputs and outputs will be stored in the workspace
            - There are three types of jobs:
                - Command: 
                    - Execute a single script
                - Sweep:
                    - Perform Hyperparameter tuning when executing a single script
                - Pipeline:
                    - Run a pipeline consisting of multiple scripts or components
