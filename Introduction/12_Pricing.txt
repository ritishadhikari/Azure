    - Every resources in Azure lives within a Subscription
    - Any Azure Account can have multiple subscriptions. Useful for organizing who 
    pays for what
    - One or more users can be a billing admin, which manages anything to do with 
    billing and invoicing on Azure. Ensures separation of responsibility
    - A billing cycle on Azure is either 30 or 60 days
    - Offer type is the type of subscription. There are many different ones at any 
    one time:
        - Free trial
        - Pay-as-you-go
        - Pay-as-you-go Dev/Test
        - Enterprise Dev/Test
        - Visual Studio Enterprise Subscribers
        - Others
    - Management Groups:
        - Group Subscriptions and take action across subscriptions in bulk.
        - Very Useful in large organizations with many subscriptions
        - Helps to organize by managing access, policies and compliance in bulk, ex.
        have a management group per country or department
        - Maintain the billing associated with the right budgets.
        - Nest Management Groups to indicated heirarchy and relationship

Azure Cost Management:
    - Free Accounts comes with many free services such as Virtual machines, Databases,
    storage and some services are always free upto a certain threshold like 
    Azure Functions, Load Balancers etc
    - Access the Azure Cost Management tool within Azure Portal. Get a detailed view
    of current and Projected Costs.
    - Get detailed spending reports and recommendations on how to save on costs and
    analyze them
    - Optimize your current resources to save money and monitor any Amazon Web Services 
    charges too
    - Spot VMS:
        - Spot VMs are unused capacity in Azure   
        - Save upto 90% of the price by chosing spot VMs
        - Not guaranteed they will run forever
        - Don't put any critical production process on a spot VM
        - Set a max price for the spot VMs

Pricing Factors:
    - Calculating Azure costs on mature infrastructure is almost impossible
    - Resource Sizes where a powerful virtual machine will cost more
    - Resource Type where resources which is used for performing a more complex
    job will cost more
    - Location where rates and labor costs have an influence on Pricing
    - Bandwidth your services are incurring 
    - Three Billing Zones
        - Each zones includes many regions
        - Data Transfer Services within the same zone is free (Ingress) while data transfers
        between any two billing zone is charged (Egress)
    - Azure Pricing Calculator helps to calculate the pricing based on the consumption of 
    resources and export estimate for further analysis and use
    - Total Cost of Ownership Calculator estimates total savings over a period of time by using
    Azure say 5 years over using on prem

Best Practices:
    - Some Azure accounts with monthly credits to use will have default spending limits. When the 
    credits are used, the limit kicks in and stops use of resource that would incur a cost
    - When the credits are gone, either remove the limit entirely or leave it in effect.
    - Caveat: Pay-as-you-go accounts have no spending limit functionality
    - Quota:
        - Quota is a limit on a certain property of an Azure Service
        - The quotas are necessary to ensure Azure can maintain their high service level
        - If you need to increase the quota, you can ask Microsoft to increase them 
    - Tags:
        - Non Functional
        - Attach to resource or resource group
        - Use as many tags as you want
        - Protect sensitive data by defining which roles can access a resource
        - To make bulk processing and updating easier, define which resources are related
        - Filter resources per project, customer or for reporting purposes
    - Pay-as-you-go:
        - It is an expensive proposition over a long term
    - Reserved Instances:
        - Can save a lot of cash over a long term, ex. reserve a VM
        - 1 year or 3 Years allocation with upto 70% off 
        - Not all Azure Services can be reserved
    - Reserved Capacity: 
        - Comes with a 1 and 3 years commitment
        - You can change regions, scale up or down, apply it to multiple subscriptions
        and cancel at any time
        - Azure SQL (save upto 80%)
        - Cosmos DB (save upto 65%)
        - Synapse Analytics (save upto 65%)
        - Redis Cache (save upto 55%)

    - Azure Hybrid Benefits
        - Azure would let you use existing licenses instead of forcing you to purchase new ones
        with every new VM or server
