    - Object detection
    - Semantic Segmentation
    - Image Analysis
    - Face detection & Recognition:
        - Detect Face, Age and Emotional State
    - Optical Character Recognition

 Azure Computer Vision:
    - Provides a pre-trained computer vision model that can be used to analyze images
    - Provides Captions, Tags as well as Ratings
    - Either use Computer Vision or Cognitive Services

Training Models with the Custom Vision Service:
