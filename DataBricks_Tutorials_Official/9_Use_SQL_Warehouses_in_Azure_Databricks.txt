Introduction:
    - Azure Databricks provides support for SQL based data analytics 
    through SQL Warehouses

Get Started with SQL Warehouses:
    - SQL Warehouses (formerly SQL endpoints) provide a relational 
    database interface for data in Azure Databricks
    - The data is stored in files that are abstracted by Delta Tables
    - From the perspective of the user, SQL warehouses behaves like 
    a relational database
    - Configuration settings for SQL warehouse include:
        - Name: 
        - Cluster Size:
        - Auto Stop:
            - The amount of time the cluster will remain when idle before
            being stopped
            - Idle clusters continue to incur charges when running
        - Scaling:
            - The minimum and maximum number of clusters used to 
            distribute query processing
        - Type:
            - Serverless, Pro or Classic SQL

Create Databases and Tables:
    - All SQL Warehouse contain a default schema named default
    - You can also create custom database schema
    ```
        %sql
        CREATE SCHEMA salesdata
    ```
    ```
        %sql
        CREATE DATABASE salesdata
    ```
    - You can use the user interface in the Azure Databricks portal to 
    upload delimited data from a wide range of common data sources
    - The imported data is stored in files in Databricks File System 
    (DBFS) storage, and a Delta table is defined for it in the Hive
    Metastore
    ```
        CREATE TABLE 
            salesdata.salesorders
            (
                orderid INT,
                orderdate DATE,
                customerid INT,
                ordertotal DECIMAL
            )
        USING 
            delta
        LOCATION
            "/data/sales/"
    ```
Create queries and dashboards:
    - You can use the SQL Editor in the Azure Databricks portal to create
    a query based on any valid SQL SELECT statement and then save the
    query with a meaningful name to be retrieved
    - Dashboards enable you to display the results of queries either
    as tables of data or as graphical visualizations
