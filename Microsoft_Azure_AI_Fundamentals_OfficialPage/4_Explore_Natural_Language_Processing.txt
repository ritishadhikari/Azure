Analyze text with the Language service:

    - The language service is a part of the Azure Cognitive Services offerings that can perform 
    advanced natural language processing over raw text

    - The Language Cognitive Service can help simplify application development by using pre-trained
    models that can:
        - Determine the language of a document or text (for ex. French or English). Submit multiple
        Documents at a time. Returns the following output:
            - The language name (ex. English)
            - The ISO 639-1 language code (ex. "en")
            - A score indicating a level of confidence in the language detection
        - Perform Sentiment Analysis on text to determine a positive or negative Sentiment
            - Score between 0 to 1
            - Close to 1 is a positive Sentiment
            - Close to 0 is a negative Sentiment
            - Close to 0.5 is a neutral sentiment 
        - Extract Key phrases from text that might indicate its main talking points
            - Used to identify important elements of the review   
        - Identify and categorize entities in the text. Entities can be people, places, organizations
        or even everyday items such as dates, times, quantities and so on

    - The Language Service can be provisioned through a:
        - Language Resource: 
            - For exclusive access and managing and billing separately
        - Cognitive Service Resource
            - If you want to pair this service with other cognitive services and managing and billing
            togather
    
    - Language Detection:
        - For a sentence having text with mixed languages, the language detection service will focus on 
        the predominant language in the text
        - The service uses an algorithm to determine the predominant language, such as length of phrases 
        or total amount of text for the language compared to other languages in the text
        - The predominant language will be the value returned, along with the language code
        - The confidence score may be less than 1 as a result of the mixed language text
        - For ambitious and mixed language content like ":-)", it results in a value of "unknown" 
        for the language name and the language identifier, and a score of NaN
    
    - Sentiment Analysis:
        - A list of words in a sentence that has no structure could result in an indeterminate score
        - Also if the content is in some different language and the language is passed different, 
        that will also generate an indeterminate score
    
    - Entity Recognition:
        - It is essentially an item of a particular type or a category and in some cases, subtype
        - The service also supports entity linking to help disambiguate entities by linking to a 
        specific reference. For recognized entities, the service returns a URL for a relevant 
        Wikipedia article
