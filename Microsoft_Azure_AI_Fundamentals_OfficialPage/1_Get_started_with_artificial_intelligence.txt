        codex into a plugin for developer environments like Visual Studio Code

    - Understanding OpenAI's Image generation capabilities:
        - The models that works with images is called DALL-E
        - Image generation falls into three categories:
            - Image Generation:
                - Original images can be generated by providing a text prompt of
                what you would like the image to be of
                - The more detailed the prompt, the more likely the model will provide a desired result
            - Editing an Image:
                - DALL-E can edit images by uploading the original image and
                specifying a transparent mask that indicates what area of the image to edit
                - The third paramater is a prompt indicating what is to be edited which instructs the model 
                to generate the appropriate content to fill the area
            - Image Variations:
                - Can be created by providing an image, and specifying how many 
                variations of the image you would like
                - The general content of the image will stay the same, but aspects will
                be adjusted such as location of the subjects, background scene and color.
    
    - OpenAI's access:
        - Access to Azure OpenAI is currently limited
        - Customers that wish to use Azure OpenAI must submit a registration form for
