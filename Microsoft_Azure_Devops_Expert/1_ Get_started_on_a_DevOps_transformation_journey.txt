Intoduction to Devops
    - Devops professionals design and implement application code and infrastructure
    strategies that allow continous integration, testing, delivery, monitoring,
    and feedback
    - Devops professionals must design and implement Devops practices for version
    control, compliance, infrastructure as code, configuration management, build,
    release and testing-using Azure technologies
    - When you adopt devops practices:
        - You shorten your cycle time by working in smaller batches
        - Using more automation
        - Hardening your release pipeline
        - Improving your telemetry
        - Deploying more frequently
    - Continous Integration drives the ongoing merging and testing of code,
    leading to an early finding of defects. Other befenefits include less
    time wasted fighting merge issues and rapid feedback for development teams
    - Continous Delivery of software solutions to production and testing
    environments helps organizations quickly fix bugs and respond to ever-changing
    business requirements
    - Version Control enables teams worldwide to communicate effectively during
    daily development activities and integrate with software development tools for
    monitoring activities such as deployments
    - Monitoring and Logging of running applications, including production 
    environments for application health and customer usage
    - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables the automation and validation of the
    creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable 
    applications hosting platforms
    - Microservices architecture isolates business use cases into small reusable
    services that communicate via interface contracts. This architecture enables
    scalability and efficiency
    - Advantages of Shorter Timelines:
        - It is easier to change plans or priorities when necessary
        - The reduced delay between doing work and getting feedback helps ensure
        that the learnings and feedback are incorporated quickly
        - It is easier to keep organizational support when positive outcomes
        are clear

Choose the right Project:
    - Devops can succeed both in greenfield as well as brownfield projects
    - Management might have a stronger sense of urgency to point brownfield
    projects in an appropriate direction when compared to greenfield projects
    that don't currently exists
    - In looking to take the first step, many organizations start with a greenfield
    project and then move on
    - Systems of Record:
        - Systems that provide the truth about data elements
        - These systems have historically evolved slowly and carefully
        - Ex. It is crucial that a banking system accurately reflects your balance
        - It emphasize accuracy and security
    - Systems of Engagement:
        - Systems that are more exploratory
        - Uses experimentation to solve new problems and are modified regularly
        - An issue with a system of engagement might end up causing a problem
        in a system of record

    - Devops practices apply to both types of systems, while the most significant 
    outcomes often comes from transforming systems of record

    - Users are categorized into three general buckets:
        - Canary:
            - Users who voluntarily test bleeding edge features as soon as they
            are available
        - Early Adopters:
            - Voluntarily preview releases, considered more refined than the code
            that exposes canary users
        - Users:
            - Consumes the products after passing through canary and early Adopters
    
    - It is essential to find staff members keen to see new features as soon as
    they are available and highly tolerant of issues when choosing canary
    - It is essential to find improvement goals that:
        - Can be used to gain early wins
        - Small enough to be achievable in a reasonable timeframe
        - Has benefits that are significant enough to be evident to the organization
        - Allows constant learning from rapid feedback and recovering from mistakes
        quickly
    
    KPIs based on Faster Outcomes:
        - Deployment Frequency:
            - Increase the frequency of deployment
        - Deployment Speed:
            - Necessary to reduce the time that it takes
        - Deployment Size:
            - How many features, stories and bug fixes are being deployed each time
        - Lead Time:
            - How long does it take from the creation of a work item until it
            is completed
    
    KPIs based on Efficiency:
        - Server to Admin Ratio:
            - Number of admins required for a given number of servers
            - Less the better
        - Staff Members to Customers Ratio:
            - Staff members for a given number of customers
            - Less the better
        - Application Usage:
            - How busy the application
        - Application Performance:
            - Is the application performance improving or degrading  
    
    - KPI based on Quality and Security:

        - Application Failure Rate:
            - How often do application failures occur, such as configuration
            failures, performance failures and so on
        - Mean time to recover:
            - How quickly can you recover from a failure
        - Bug Report Rates:
