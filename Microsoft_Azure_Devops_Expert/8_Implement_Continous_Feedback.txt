Implement tools to track usage and flow:
    - If someone is working on a library, their inner loop includes coding, building, 
    testing and debugging with regular commits to the local git repository
    - The four steps that takes place inside the inner loop is:
        - Coding (Experimentation)
        - Building (Feedback Collection)
        - Testing/ Debugging (Feedback Collection)
        - Committing (Tax)
    - Of all the steps in the inner loop, coding is the only one that adds customer
    value

    - Continous Monitoring:
        - Continous Monitoring helps to continously ensure your application's health,
        performance, reliability and infrastructure as it moves from development to 
        production
        - Azure Monitor is the unified monitoring solution in Azure that provides 
        full-stack observability across applications and infrastructure in the cloud
        and on-premise
        - Continous monitoring in Devops release pipeline allows you to gate or roll
        back your deployment based on monitoring data
        - Automatically get platform metrics, activity logs and diagnostics logs
        from most of your Azure Resources with no configuration
        - Enable deeper monitoring for AKS cluters with Azure Monitor for containers
        and for VMs with Azure Monitor
        - For Infrastructure as a Code:
            - Use Resource Manager templates to enable monitoring and configure alerts
            over a large set of Resources
            - Use Azure Policy to enforce different rules over your resources, which 
            ensures that those resources comply with your corporate standards and SLAs
        - Azure Monitor for Resource Groups provides a simple way to keep track of 
        health and performance of your entire full-stack application and enables drilling
        down into respective components for any investigations or debugging
        - Create alerts in Azure Monitor based on logs and metrics to identify 
        predictable failure states  
        - It is best to make all alerts actionable with the help of actions for 
        notification, ex. SMS, e-mails, push notifications or voice calls
        - Prepare custom dashboards based on standard metrics and logs for the different
        roles in your organization
        - Dashboards can combine data from all Azure resources
        - Prepare Workbooks to ensure knowledge sharing between development and operations
        which can help customer support or handle fundamental problems
        - Azure Monitor helps you collect metrics and logs relevant to your business and 
        add new data points and use in the following deployment:
            - Use tools in Application Insights to track end-user behavior and 
            engagement
            - Use Impact Analysis to help you prioritize which areas to focus on to
            drive to important KPIs
    - Azure Monitor:
        - Azure Monitor provides Management tools, such as those in Azure Security
        Center and Azure Automation, enabling ingestion of custom log data to Azure 
        - The service aggregates and stores this telemetry in a log data store
        optimized for cost and performance
    
    - Log Analytics:
        - Log Analytics works by running the Microsoft Monitoring Agent service on the
        machine
        - The service locally captures and buffers the events and pushes them securely
        out to the Log Analytics workspace in Azure
        - You can add multiple log analytics workspaces to publish the log data into 
        various workspaces
        -
