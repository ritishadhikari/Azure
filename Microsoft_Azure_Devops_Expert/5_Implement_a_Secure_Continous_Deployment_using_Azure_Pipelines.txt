Introduction to Deployment Patterns:
    - Azure Pipelines can be used to create a fully featured cross-platform CI and 
    CD service
    - Microservices Architecture:
        - Interaction between the microservices is done asynchronously
        - They don't call each other directly, but use asynchronous mechanisms like
        queues or events
    - In classical deployment patterns, despite the different stages to test and
    validate, this approach still involves a lot of risks
