Virtual Machines:
    - Infrastructure as a Service:
        - Manage everything except the hardware
        - This includes the networking components
    - Tools:
        - Use the Azure Portal to manage large number of VMs and even hybrid clouds
    - Compliance:
        - Use Azure Blueprints to make your VMs comply with company guidelines
    - Recommendations:
        - Azure will recommend improvements to ensure better security, higher availability and 
        greater performance
    - Choice:
        - Chose amount of RAM, number of CPUs, Windows or Linux
    - Pricing:
        - Goes up as RAM and CPU goes up. Calculated Hourly. 
    -    

Scale Sets:
    - Helps to create a group of identical, load balanced VMs
    - Multiple VMS:
        - Simple to manage multiple identical VMs using a load balancer
    - High availability:
        - If one VM fails or stops, the others in the scale set will keep working
    - Auto Scaling:
        - Automatically match demand by adding or removing VMs from the scale set
    - Large Scale:
        - Run up to 1000 VMs in a single set
    - No Extra Cost:
        - No added cost using scale sets

App Services:
    - Part of Platform as a Service
    - Servers, Network and Storage are all managed by Azure
    - Focus just on business value and logic
    - Categories:
        - Web Apps:
            - Website and online applications hosted on Azure's managed Platform
            - Runs on both Windows and Linux
            - Supports Python, .NET, PHP, Java and Ruby
            - Azure Integration for easier deployment
            - Supports Autoscaling and Load Balancing
        -   Web Apps for Containers:
            - Deploy and Run containerized applications in Azure
            - A container is completely self-contained
            - All dependencies are shipped inside the container
            - Deploy anywhere with a consistent experience
        - API Apps:
            - Expose and connect your data backend

Azure Container Instances (ACI):
    - A container provides all of the necessary dependencies such as frameworks, other pieces
    of software, operating system interfaces and much more
    - All the dependencies for an application are included in the container image. You can manage
    the application and its dependencies with confidence
    - Unlike Virtual Machines which requires a lot more maintenance and updates, containers don't
    have any components relating to the operating system that require maintenance
    - Applications running in containers can be deployed easily to multiple different operating 
    systems and hardware platforms
    - Development, Deployment and maintenance are all more efficient when using containers. Scaling
    and patching is much simpler
    - First create software development cycle, then place the application in a container and 
    finally put it in Azure Container Instances
    - ACI is a primary Azure Service for running container process or application (workload) 
    - Use containerized applications to process data on demand by only creating the container image
    when you need it. Thereby save cash
    - We can use either of the Azure Portal, Azure CLI or PowerShell

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):
    - Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating application 
    deployment, scaling and management
    - Kubernetes will deploy more images of containers as needed
    - Automating scaling happens in Kubernetes by automatically monitoring of application load
    to determine when to scale the number of containers used
    - AKS helps to reuse your container architecture by managing it in Kubernetes. This makes the 
    setup quicker and confidence in the system increases
    - You can use Kubernetes with supported Azure regions and on premise installations using Azure
    Stack

Azure Container Registry(ACR):
    - This service keeps track of current valid container images
    - It manages files and artifacts for containers
    - Feeds container images to ACI and AKS
    - Use Azure Identity and Security Features so that as to ensure the container images are 
    safe and sound

Azure Virtual Desktop:
    - Use any VM size and configuration you want in Azure to host the windows 10/11 Instances
    - This is a completely virtualized version of windows, meaning it runs 100% in the cloud
    - We can use Windows 10/11 licenses thereby saving costs and license usage
    - Multiple users can use the same VM instance
    - Use Windows from anywhere on any device with an internet browser
    - Secure data using Azure Storage

Functions:
    - It is the smallest compute service on Azure
    - A single function of compute
    - It is called or invoked via a standard web adsress (URL)  
    - Runs once and stops. No Traffic, no usage
    - No Maintenance, No Processes, Nothing VM related, just focus on functionality
    -
