Cloud Service Models:
    - Infrastructure as a Service: 
        - Infrastructure are actual servers that are provided by Azure
        - Scaling is fast
        - No ownership of hardware

    - Platform as a Service:
        - Also includes Middlewares, Darabase Systems and More
        - It supports the web application lifecycle
        - Avoids software licence problems
    - Software as a Service:
        - Provides a managed Service
        - Pay an access fee to used
        - No maintenance and latest features
    - Serverless:
        - Azure Functions
        - A single function of code can be hosted, deployed, run and managed without
        having to manage a full application
    - Shared Repsonsibility Model:
        -       
Azure Marketplace
