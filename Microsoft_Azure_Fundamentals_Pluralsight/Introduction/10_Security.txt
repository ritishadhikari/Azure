Defence in Depth:
    - You are responsible for the security of the physical hardware, buildings and
    stuffs
    - You will have several layers of Defence, as with a castle, such as swipe cards, 
    security guards, firewalls and more
    - You own the infrastructure, so you are responsible for adequate defense of hardware 
    and data
    - Layers:
        - Physical:
            - Actual Data Center where only the authorized personnel has access
        - Identity and Access:
            - Azure Active Directory which contains all access to Azure
        - Perimeter: 
            - Protection Against DDOS attacks, Volumetric Attacks, Protocol Attacks, etc
        - Network:
            - Filter of traffic to and from Azure using Virtual Networks applying Security
            standards
        - Compute:
            - Protects against intruders trying to get into your virtual machines or databases
        - Gateways and Firewalls:
            - Provides security to Azure Applications
        - Data 
            - Encrypted against anyone authorized reading it or making sense of it

Securing Network Connectivity:
    - DDOS Protection Service:
        - Detects DDOS attacks and deflects it. Various levels of protection depending
        on scenario
        - No interruption to your service at all. Azure mitigates the attack globally.
    - Network Security Group:
        - Personal Resource Firewall. Attach to virtual network, subnet or network 
        interface
        - A NSG determines who can access the resources attached to it, using rules for
        inbound and outbound traffic
    - Application Security Groups:
        - Focueses on securing the application rather than the IP Endpoint
        - Group VMs and Virtual networks into logical application groups and apply 
        an application security Group


Public and Private Endpoints:
    - Public Endpoints refers to Publicly reachable Paas Services
    - Managed PaaS services are reachable over the public Internet
    - Service Endpoints (Good Solution):
        - Privately connect VNet subnet to Azure PaaS services directly
        - Connect over Microsoft's private backbone (not over public internet)
        - Configure service to only allow traffic from service endpoint-enabled subnet
        - Provides secured access to only Azure Virtual Networks
        - No Private on premise access, hence must allow on-premise access over public IP
        - PaaS public endpoint still exists, not truly private
        - Service endpoints provide access to an entire service
    - Private Endpoints (Better Solution):
        - Managed Network Interface
        - Can Provide pricate connection to specific instance of a service, ex., single storage 
        account, SQL instance, etc
        - Available over connected networks, i.e., Hybrid/On-premise networks and peered 
        virtual networks
        - Can completely disable public access to a connected service, hence truly private

Microsoft Defender for cloud (formerly Azure Security Center):
    - Provides Threat Alerts
    - Ready for Hybrid Architectures
    - Each VM has an agent installed that sends data
    - Azure analyzes the data and alerts you if necessary
    - Policy and compliance metrics
    - A secure score to encourage great security hygiene
    - Integrates with other cloud providers (requires Azure Arc)
    - Alerts for resources that aren't secure
    - Setup Policies for Azure to monitor resource resources from. 
    - A policy is a set of rules used to evaluate a resource
    - Use Predefined policies or create your own
    - Actively protect your resources through monitoring your policies and their outcomes
    - Respond to any security alerts, investigate all of them and then define new policies
    to account for the alerts

Key Vault:
    - Attackers eventually gets to know where you keep your keys
    - Secure place to store passwords and other secrets
    - Share those secrets with others without revealing the actual secret
    - The key vault is secure too. Not even Microsoft can access the keys in it
    - An application can't pass on secrets, nor access another applications secret
    - Scale Globally like any other managed Azure Service

Azure Information Protection:
    - Secure Documents, emails and data outside of the company network
    - Classify data according to how sensitive it is either using policies or manually
    - Track what is happening with shared data and revoke access if needed
    - Safely share data as you can control who edits, views, prints and forwards it
    - Controls for document access is integrated with common applications and tools, 
    such as Microsoft Office

Microsoft Defender for Identity (formerly Advanced Threat Protection):
    - Monitor Users by analyzing user activity and information. This includes any permissions
    and memberships or groups
    - Records what a user's normal behavior and routine is. Any activity outside this routine
    will be logged as suspicious
    - This service will suggest changes to confirm with security best practices in order to
    reduce risks
    - If a user is searching for information about other users, device IP addresses and more, 
    Microsoft Defender for Identity will raise alerts (Reconnaissance)
    - Any attempts to guess user credentials will be identified and flagged (Brute Force)
    - Any attempt by a user to gain more privileges will be flagged. This can be through
    another user's login (Increasing Privileges)

Azure Sentinel:
    - It is a security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool
    - Steps Involved are:
        - Data Collection
        - Aggregation and Normalization
        - Analysis and Threat Detection
        - Take Action
    - Focusses on Behavior Analytics through Artificial Intelligence

Azure Dedicated Hosts:
    - You get control of an entire physical server on Azure
    - Physical Layer isolation means you won't get any foreign VMs on your dedicated Hosts
    - Reduce impact of your system by choosing when to install updates to your dedicated host
    - Take Advantage of the stringent Azure Compliance in combination with managing your own hardware
    - Availability zones, fault isolation, high availability and scale sets comes as standard. No
    optional extras here
    - Chose Windows, Linux or SQL Server on a range of VM sizes.
