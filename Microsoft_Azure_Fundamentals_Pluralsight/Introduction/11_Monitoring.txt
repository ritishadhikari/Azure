Governance
    - It is a set of rules, policies and roles to define acceptable use of Azure Resources
    - Azure Policy:
        - A policy is a set of rules to ensure resources are compliant
    - Role Based Access Control (RBAC):
        - You can define specific user access to individual resources
        - RBAC can enable minimum access necessary to resources. This ensures only users with
        valid access can manage resources
        - You can be very explicit about users and access. For example, allow an application
        access to certain resources or allow a user to manage resources in a resource group
        - Role definition is a collection of permissions such as read, write and delete
    - Locks:
        - Assigns a lock to a subscription, resource group or resource
        - A lock can be of two types. 
            - Read only, where you can't make any changes to the object
            - Delete, where you can't delete the locked object
        - A lock needs to be removed before the locked actions can be performed again
    - Azure BluePrints:
        - Blueprints are templates for creating Azure Resources
        - It contains
            - Resource templates

            - Policies
            - Samples for common regulations
    - Cloud Adoption Framework:
        - Lots of resources to guide you through the cloud adoption process
        - Help to define strategies for adoption, planning the move, "being ready" for the cloud,
        adoption reasons, governing practices and managing a living, breathing cloud
        architecture
