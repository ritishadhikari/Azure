Region:
    - A region is a set of data centers deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected
    through a dedicated regional low-latency network
    - Chose a region closest to your users to minimize latency
    - Each region is paired within same geographic area except Brazil South
    - If the primary region has an outage, you can failover to the secondary region
    - Only one region in a pair is updated at any one time

Availability Zones:
    - Each availability zone is a physical location within a region
    - Each AZ is independent, has its own power, cooling and networking
    - Each region has three availability zones

Resource Groups:
    - Resource Group is not a resource but a container that holds related resources for Azure
    Solution and includes those resources that you want to manage as a Group
    - Each resource can only exist in a single resource Group
    - You can add or remove resources to any resource group at any time
    - You can move a resource from one resource group to another
    - Resources from multiple regions can be in one resource group
    - You can give users access to a resource group and everything in it
    - Resources can interact with other resources in different resource groups
    - A resource group has a location, or region as it stores meta data about the resources
    in it

Azure Resource Manager: 
    - All interaction with Azure resources go through the ARM
    - It is the main Azure Architecture component for creating, updating and manipulating
    resources
    - Group Resource Handling:
        - Deploy, manage and monitor resources as a group rather than handling individually
    - Consistency:
        - Deploying resources from various tools will always result in the same consistent state
    - Dependencies:
        - Define dependencies between resources to make sure they don't get into fight
    - Access Control:
        - Built-in-Features in the ARM make it easy to assign rights to users
    - Tagging:
        - Tag (label) resources to easily identify them for future scenarios 
    - Billing:
        - Check billing for a group of resources sharing the same tag
