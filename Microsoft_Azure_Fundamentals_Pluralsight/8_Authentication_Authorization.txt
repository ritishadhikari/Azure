Identity services
    - Authorization comes after Authentication
    - Authorization is much more granular signifying if we have access

Azure Active Directory
    - Main Tool to manage users and permissions on Azure
    - Active Directory was designed for traditional office use with computers and printers
    - The web as a concept or service was not part of the design for Active Directory in 2000
    - Active Directory authentication uses services that aren't available on Azure
    - Active Directory is not Azure Active Directory
    - You cannot have an Azure account without an AAD service
    - Every Azure account needs a first user and this user is in the initial AAD instance
    - A tenant represents the organization, which is a dedicated instance of AAD that an organization
    receives when signing up for Azure
    - Each tenant is distict and completely separate from other AAD tenants
    - Each user in Azure can be a member or guest of up to 500 Azure AD tenants
    - Subscriptions are billing entities and all resources within a subscription are billed togather
    - All resources within a subscription are billed togather and you can have a multiple Subscriptions
    within a tenant to separate costs
    - If a subscription isn't paid, all the resources and services associated with the subscription
    stop
    - AAD bridges the On-Premise and Azure 

Zero Trust Concepts:
    - Trusted Perimeter refers to trust boundary for secure access. 
        - Example: Corporate Network where private access to secure networks can be restricted
        - With Trusted Perimiter Model, remote work is a challenge. VPN is an extension of trust perimiter
        - Mobile Network connectivity will be a challenge even with VPN
        - Rogue user/malware inside trusted network can cause havoc
    - Zero Trust security Model
        - All users assumed untrustworthy unless proven otherwise
        - Trusted by identity regardless of location (trusted/untrusted networks) 
        - Least privilege access - just enough permissions to perform job
        - Centrally control access with conditional access Policies
        - Additional options with allowing access only from approved managed devices which may be 
        independent from network location

Multi-Factor Authentication 
    - Need atleast two ways to identify yourself to log in through
        - Something you know - password
        - Something you have - App on Mobile
        - Something you are - fingerprint/retina scan
    - Enabled through Azure Active Directory and is treated as a First Class Citizen in Azure

Conditional Access:
    - Premium feature built into Azure Active directory 
    - Authentication beyond Username/ Password 
    - If/then policy to grant access
    - If user meets these conditions (signals), then grant/block access to defined applications
    - Often paired with multi-factor authentication (MFA) 
    - Does not rely on end user enabling MFA
    - Assign signals (conditions)
        - Users/ groups
        - Application to grant/ deny access
        - Location (IP)
        - Approved Devices 
    - Access Decisions (grant/block access)
        - Grant Access
        - Block Access
        - Require MFA

Passwordless Authentication:
    - Multifactor Authentication is more secure but less convenient as more steps are Required
    to log in
    - Objective is to Increase Convenience while staying secure
    - Remove Password from System Login with Something you have (phone) and something you 
    know/are (on device)
    - Three Methods to Passwordless authentication
        - Microsoft Authenticator App
            - Configure in Azure Active Directory
            - Authenticate in app with biometrics/PIN
        - Windows Hello 
            - Face Recognition in Windows
        - FIDO2 Security Key:
            - Hardware Key  

External Guest Access:
    - Scenario: 
        - Working with outside consultant to streamline Azure or Azure AD configuration
    - Create separate organization account for external user
        - Problem is it would require external user to juggle two Accounts
    - Invite Guest user to Azure tenant
        - Guest user uses existing account as an external collaborator
        - B2B Collaboration
        - Invite a variety of account types (identity providers, Microsoft, Google, Facebook)
        - Other external identity providers can also be invited as well
        - Assign permissions for guest account with the principle of least privilege
        - Different permissions between Azure AD and Azure Subscriptions

Azure Active Directory Domain Services
    - Limitations of Azure AD and Cloud Migrations
        - Legacy Applications are unable to use modern authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0)
        - Requires traditional Active Directory (AD DS) management/protocols
            - Group Policy
            - LDAP
            - NTLM
            - Kerberos
    - One solution can be to continue using on-premise Active Directory
        - Sync to Azure AD with Azure AD connect
    - Another solution is to configure AD server on Azure VM
        - Also known as self-managed AD DS
        - Maintain/ Configure the operating system (OS) that the active directory runs on
    - Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AS DS):
        - Managed Active Directory Domain Services
        - Provides classic AD features in a managed service
            - Group Policy, LDAP, Kerberos, domain join  
    - AADDS is a fully managed service
    - No need for OS configuration/management
    - Behind the scenes: two windows domain controllers for high availability
    - Need to create Unique Namespace/domain name 
    - One way sync from Azure AD to Azure AD DS by synchronization of users, groups and credentials

Single Sign-On
    - One username and pasword to log onto multiple applications 
    - Official Name: Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-On
    - Enable Single Sign On in AAD
