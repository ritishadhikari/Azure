Virtual Network (VNet):
    - Enables Azure Virtual Machines to securely connect with each other, the internet and 
    on premises network
    - No access to the hardware of the network
    - Address Space: 
        - Range of IP Addresses that you can use for your resources
    - Subnets:
        - Enables you to segment the virtual network into one or more subnetworks and allocate
        portions of the virtual network's address space to each subnet. 
        - Doing this, we can have multiple networks in the same VNet
        - Subnet helps in grouping resources to make it easier to keep an overview
        - Each individual subnets can be secured using network security groups
    - A Vnet belongs to a single region. Every resource on the VNet must be in the same region too
    - Each Vnet belongs to a single subscription, and each subscription can have more than one VNet
    though
    - Adding more VNets or more addresses to one is simple - Scale
    - VNet ensures high availability for resources. Peering Vnets using a load balancer or using a VPN
    gateway all increase availability
    - Isolate, manage and organize resources with subnets and network security groups 
    - VNet Peering:
        - Lets you to connect two or more virtual networks in Azure 
        - Traffic between Virtual Machines in a peered network uses the Private Microsoft Backbone
        and never passes through the public internet 
        - Provides low latency and high bandwidth connection between resources
        - Resources in separate VNets can communicate 
        - Transfer data easily between subscriptions and deployment models in separate regions

Load Balancer
    - It distributes new inbound flows that arrive on the load balancer's frontend to backend pool
    instances, according to rules and health probes
    - Health Probes, ensures that the Load Balancer always sends traffic to a healthy VM

VPN Gateway
    - Securely communicate with Azure Resources and your on-premises network 
    - Virtual Network Gateway consists of two or more virtual machines that are deployed to a specific
    subnet called the Gateway Subnet
    - The VMs are created in the Gateway Subnet when you create a Virtual Network Gateway 
    - VPN Gateway is a specific type of Virtual Network Gateway that is used to send encrypted traffic 
    between a Azure Virtual Network and an on-premises location over the public internet
    - A VPN Gateway is a key part of having a secure and available hybrid cloud architecture 
    - Main Components of a VPN Gateway setup:
        - VPN gateway in a Azure VNet with its own public IP address
        - A secure connection called Tunnel which has one of a number of encryption mechanisms
        - On Premises Network with a complimentary gateway that can accept the encrypted data 
        - The above is called Site-to-Site connection 
    - There can be one VPN gateway with more than one on-prem network connecting to it. This is
    known as multisite connection

Application Gateway
    - A load balancer receives Internet Traffic and based on an IP address and port, it will send
    one of the data in the backend pool
    - With Application Gateway, you can make routing decisions based on additional attributes like
    HTTPs requests such as URI path and host headers. 
    - Data format:
        URI: Web Address
        Host Header: Request Data
    - Scale the Application Gateway up or down based on the amount of traffic received
    - Comply with any security policies. Disable or enable traffic encryption to the backend
    - Span multiple availability zones and improve fault resiliency
    - Multi Site Hosting: 
        - Use the same Application Gateway for up to 100 websites
   
ExpressRoute
    - Private, Secure, High Bandwidth, low latency, connection directly from data center 
    infrastructure to Azure  
    - Applicable when lots of data interchange takes place between on-prem and Azure
    - Express Route don't go over the public internet which means security of the data is better

Content Delivery Network
    - It is a distributed network of servers that can deliver web content close to users
    - CDN improves the user's experience and the performance of your Application
    - Scale to suit any spikes in traffic and also protect your main backend server instance from
    high loads
    - Edge server will serve requests closest to the user, less traffic is then sent to the server 
    hosting your Application
